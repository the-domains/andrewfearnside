Light in the Bosque

The Bosque is over-full. Thousands of leaves, each curling into the light; hundreds of fallen trees, bark sloughed off to reveal ripples of skin-like, muscle-like flesh. 

And yet things are simple here, as the land is mostly flat. The horizon cuts through everything. 

There's this gap between the bone-feel of the Bosque drawing me into itself and these images. I have to keep searching. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b75a1a76-048f-4ce8-aed6-341f839b63eb.jpg)
